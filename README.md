# Ionic GitHub Pages Deployment
[![Deploy Ionic App to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/danielcregg/ionic-deploy-github-pages/actions/workflows/deploy-to-gh-pages-caller.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/danielcregg/ionic-deploy-github-pages/actions/workflows/deploy-to-gh-pages-caller.yml)

Deploy your Ionic Angular app to GitHub Pages automatically using GitHub Actions.

Live Demo of this Ionic App: https://danielcregg.github.io/ionic-deploy-github-pages/

## üöÄ Setup Instructions (2 Steps)

1. **Add the workflow file to your repo**:
   - Option A: Copy the above GitHub Workflow `.github/workflows/deploy-to-gh-pages-caller.yml` to your Ionic Angular app repository. Please note there are two workflows in the workflows folder `deploy-to-gh-pages-caller.yml` and `deploy-to-gh-pages-reusable.yml`. The caller workflow just calls the reusable workflow. This is so I can make updates to the reusable workflow and as long as you have the caller workflow in your repository you will get the latest updates.
   - Option B: If you are using a terminal and you are in your Ionic Angular app repository you can run the following terminal command:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p .github/workflows && \
     curl -o .github/workflows/deploy-to-gh-pages-caller.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielcregg/ionic-deploy-github-pages/main/.github/workflows/deploy-to-gh-pages-caller.yml
     ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - On Github at the top of your repository page go to **Settings** and choose **Pages** from the menu bar on the left
   - Under **Build and deployment**, select **GitHub Actions** as the Source

That's it! Push your changes and your app will deploy to `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`
